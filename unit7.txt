18. Explain, in detail, what happens when this script is run: 

var shout = function(){   // declare a variable to equal a function.
    var message = "HEY YOU"; // inside function variable message contains text "HEY YOU"
    alert(message);}; //  inside function call 
shout();
alert(message);

19. Explain, in detail, what happens when you run this script:

alert("Hello"); //dialogue box pops out that says "Hello"
var alert = 2; // Overrides the alert function and sets it to 2
alert("World"); // this doesn't work because now the alert function is just a var that equals 2.

27. Write a constructor for movie objects. A movie has a title, an MPAA rating, a list of directors, a list of producers, a studio, and a release date.

function movies(title, rating, director, producer, studio, releaseDate){
	this.movieTitle = title;
	this.movieRating = rating;
	this.movieDir = directos;
	this.movieProd = producer;
	this.movieStudio = studio;
	this.movieDate = releaseDate;
}

var newMovie  = new movie("X-Men:Apocalypse","6of10",Bryan Singer","Bryan Singer","20th Century Fox","May 27 2016");

30. JavaScript comes with a built-in object called Date, which is a constructor. Research this function and answer the following:
(a) What does the expression new Date() produce? // it produces today's date.
(b) What does the expression new Date( 2009,0,20) produce? // It changes the date to Jan 20th 2009.
(c) If d1 and d2 refer to date objects, what does the expression d1. valueOf() - d2. valueOf() produce? // this will subtract the primitive value (number of millisecond since the date input)produced by d1.valueOf() with that of d2.valueOf()
